# Let's Encrypt for Brocade vTM (virtual Traffic Manager)

Purpose of this script is to allow vTM to manage certificates with the Let's Encrypt Certificate authorities.
*letsencrypt.sh* needs a third party script to handle the connection with Let's Encrypt. We use https://acme.sh for this purpose.

For installation instructions, please follow up this blog post on Brocade Community website:

Please note that native support of Let's Encrypt in vTM is in the Roadmap. Once done, this script will become obsolete.
